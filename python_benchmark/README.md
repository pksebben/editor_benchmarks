# Python benchmark

tested with emacs@28 on mac m1, using LSP.

## Usage

 - Create venv
 - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
 - open `main.py` in your editor of choice, and make sure the lines
   with comments all show the relevant error

at the moment, only actual errors are implemented, and only a few per
checker.  This is meant to just give a glanceworthy idea of whether
some or another checker *isn't* working...

## Roadmap

 - implement checking for things like code following, completion, etc.
